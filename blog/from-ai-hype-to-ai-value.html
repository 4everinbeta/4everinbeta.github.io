        <h1>From AI Hype to AI Value: A Data-First, Experiment-Driven Philosophy</h1>
        <p class="hero__intro">
          Too many AI “strategies” mirror ERP rollouts—slow, expensive, and disconnected from outcomes.
          This post lays out the data-first, problem-first, experiment-driven path I use to move from hype
          to real, provable value.
        </p>

            Every week I see another organization treat AI adoption like a traditional enterprise rollout. Months
            of planning, millions invested, and very little empirical learning. The predictable result: stalled
            “strategies,” credibility loss, and tired teams. The better question isn’t “Should we invest in AI?”
            It’s “How do we learn what AI can actually do for our business without betting the farm?”
          </p>
          <p>
            After years of leading AI initiatives and studying industry patterns, I’ve learned that success rests on
            three beliefs: <strong>data first</strong>, <strong>problems first</strong>, and
            <strong>experiments first</strong>.
          </p>

          </figure>

          <h2>My Philosophy: Data First, Problems First, Experiments First</h2>
          <h3>Data First</h3>
          <p>
            AI is only as strong as its data. You cannot skip data quality, governance, and accessibility and expect
            models to save the day. Treat data as a product with defined customers, purpose, and ownership. Clean data
            paired with a simple model beats messy data plus a bleeding-edge algorithm every time.
          </p>

          <h3>Problems First</h3>
          <p>
            Start with a measurable, high-value problem. Interview the people doing the work, map today’s journey,
            and define success before writing a line of code. Technology should serve the problem, not the other way
            around.
          </p>

          <h3>Experiments First</h3>
          <p>
            Prove value before scaling investment. Small bets, fast learning, minimal risk. Design thinking beats
            waterfall planning. It’s okay to fail—just fail fast and cheap so you can move to the next hypothesis with
            better insight.
          </p>

          <h2>Understanding Your Tools</h2>
          <p>
            “AI” is a toolbox, not a single capability. Matching the tool to the problem prevents expensive detours.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Traditional AI:</strong> Machine Learning for forecasting and risk, NLP for sentiment and classification,
              Computer Vision for document/image analysis, and RPA for deterministic workflows.</li>
            <li><strong>Generative AI:</strong> Excels at creation and transformation—summaries, Q&amp;A, deep retrieval, and
              content repackaging.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>You don’t need to be a data scientist, but you should be able to ask, “Which tool fits this specific problem?”</p>

          <h2>The 9-Week Experiment Cycle</h2>
          <p>
            I rely on a nine-week experiment cycle—rooted in design thinking—to test AI ideas with minimal spend and
            maximum learning.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Phase 1: Discover (Weeks 1–2).</strong> Pick one measurable pain point. Map the workflow, talk to the doers,
              define success metrics, and audit your data. If you can’t clearly state the problem or find the data, stop here.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Week 3: Define &amp; Design.</strong> Formulate the hypothesis: “If we use <em>X</em> on <em>Y</em>, we
              achieve <em>Z</em>.” Choose the right AI technique, estimate value, and set explicit success/failure criteria.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Weeks 4–6: Prototype.</strong> Build the minimum viable experiment with a three-to-five-person team.
              Favor off-the-shelf tools and time-box everything. If you’re still prototyping in week seven, something slipped.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Weeks 7–8: Testing &amp; Validation.</strong> Put the prototype in front of real users doing real work.
              Measure against your original metrics and collect qualitative feedback relentlessly.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Week 9: Decision.</strong> Go (plan the production build), pivot (refine the hypothesis), or kill (document
              the learning and move on). Either way, you’ve spent weeks, not millions.
            </li>
          </ol>

            <figcaption>Nine disciplined weeks are enough to prove value—or prove it isn’t there—without burning political capital.</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <h2>What This Enables</h2>
          <p>
            This cadence de-risks AI investments. You build capability by doing, not theorizing. Your portfolio becomes a mix of
            ongoing experiments, production builds, and intentional kills—each contributing insight. In one GenAI pilot for
            document summarization we hit working prototype in week four, validated ROI by week six, and shipped to production
            within four months at a fraction of the traditional cost.
          </p>

          <h2>The Non-Negotiables</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Start with data.</strong> Budget for quality, governance, and access alongside every experiment.</li>
            <li><strong>Solve real problems.</strong> Anchor each initiative to a cost, risk, or experience issue.</li>
            <li><strong>Match investment to certainty.</strong> Low certainty = low spend; scale only what’s proven.</li>
            <li><strong>Create safe space for failure.</strong> Fund multiple experiments knowing some will fail—and celebrate the learning.</li>
            <li><strong>Build through doing.</strong> Capability grows through hands-on work, not slide decks.</li>
            <li><strong>Balance speed with responsibility.</strong> Bake explainability, bias checks, and privacy into every test.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Where to Start</h2>
          <h3>This Week</h3>
          <p>Educate leadership on what AI is (and isn’t), align on vocabulary, and list three to five pain points with available data.</p>
          <h3>This Month</h3>
          <p>Pick one pain point, assemble a small team, and run your first nine-week experiment. Budget for three to five attempts expecting only a couple to succeed.</p>
          <h3>This Quarter</h3>
          <p>Build a portfolio of experiments—some running, some shipping, some intentionally retired—and share learnings across the organization.</p>
          <p>Good starting points:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Document summarization or review (GenAI)</li>
            <li>Predictive analytics on existing processes (ML)</li>
            <li>Extracting structured data from unstructured documents (NLP + CV)</li>
            <li>Automating repetitive manual tasks (RPA)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Don’t start with:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>“AI strategy” boil-the-ocean initiatives</li>
            <li>Mission-critical decisions with zero tolerance for experimentation</li>
            <li>Areas where the required data doesn’t exist</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Building Capability, Not Just Use Cases</h2>
          <p>
            This is about building organizational muscle. The winners in this AI wave won’t be first movers or biggest spenders;
            they’ll be the teams that learn fastest. Understand your problems deeply, invest in the data foundation, experiment
            constantly but responsibly, and only scale what you prove works.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Stop planning. Start experimenting. Data first, problems first, prove it in nine weeks.</strong></p>
