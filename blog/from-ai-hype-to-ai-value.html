        <h1>From AI Hype to AI Value: A Data-First, Experiment-Driven Philosophy</h1>
        <p class="hero__intro">
          Every week I see well-intentioned leaders launch AI programs that look like ERP rollouts—slow,
          expensive, and light on learning. Here’s the playbook I use instead: a data-first, problem-first,
          experiment-driven approach that proves value before it scales.
        </p>
      </section>

      <article class="surface post">

          <p>
            Every week I watch organizations make the same mistake: they treat AI adoption like enterprise software
            procurement. The question is no longer “Should we invest in AI?” It’s “How do we learn what AI can actually
            do for our business without betting the farm?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Through hands-on practice and studying repeated industry patterns, I’ve landed on a philosophy anchored in
            three beliefs: <strong>data first</strong>, <strong>problems first</strong>, and
            <strong>experiments first</strong>.
          </p>

          <h2>My Philosophy: Data First, Problems First, Experiments First</h2>
          <h3>Data First</h3>
          <p>
            AI is only as good as the data foundation beneath it. You cannot skip data quality, governance, and access
            and jump straight to modeling. Treat data as a strategic asset—better yet, treat it as a product.
          </p>
          <p>
            Netflix articulated this beautifully with its “data as a product” mindset. Every data product has a defined
            customer, a clear purpose, success measures, explicit ownership, and a roadmap. Put your data users first and
            apply product management discipline to quality, availability, and trust.
          </p>
          <p>
            Clean data with a simple model will outperform messy data with the fanciest algorithm available every single
            time.
          </p>

          <h3>Problems First</h3>
          <p>
            Start with “What problem are we trying to solve?” not “What can AI do?” Map how work happens today and talk to
            the people doing it. Define success with real metrics before you whisper “model.” Business value comes from
            solving pain, not shipping cool tech.
          </p>

          <h3>Experiments First</h3>
          <p>
            Prove value before you scale investment. Small bets, fast learning, minimal risk. This is design thinking for
            AI adoption. It’s okay to fail as long as you fail fast and cheaply—because the organizations winning with AI
            aren’t the ones spending the most, they’re the ones learning the fastest.
          </p>

          <h2>Understanding Your Tools</h2>
          <p>
            “AI” is a toolbox, not a single capability. Matching the tool to the problem prevents expensive detours.
            Before you experiment, understand the capabilities on the table.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Traditional AI:</strong> Machine Learning for forecasting and risk, NLP for sentiment and classification,
              Computer Vision for document/image analysis, and RPA for deterministic workflows.</li>
            <li><strong>Generative AI:</strong> Excels at creation and transformation—summaries, Q&amp;A, deep retrieval, and
              content repackaging.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>You don’t need to be a data scientist, but you should be able to ask, “Which tool fits this specific problem?”</p>

          <h2>The 9-Week Experiment Cycle</h2>
          <p>
            Traditional plans spend 6–12 months and millions of dollars before anyone sees value. Here’s what I do
            instead: a nine-week experiment cycle that maximizes learning while minimizing risk.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Phase 1: Discover (Weeks 1–2).</strong> Pick one measurable pain point. Map the current journey, talk
              to the people actually doing the work, define success metrics, and assess your data. Gate question: can we
              articulate the problem clearly and do we have (or can we quickly get) the data?
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Week 3: Define &amp; Design.</strong> Formulate the hypothesis: “If we use <em>X</em> on <em>Y</em>, we
              achieve <em>Z</em> outcome.” Choose the right AI technique, estimate potential value, and set explicit
              success/failure criteria. Keep it minimal—use existing tools and avoid custom builds.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Weeks 4–6: Prototype.</strong> Build the minimum viable experiment with a three-to-five-person team.
              Favor off-the-shelf tooling and time-box everything. If you’re still prototyping in week seven, something is
              wrong.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Weeks 7–8: Testing &amp; Validation.</strong> Put the prototype in front of real users doing real work.
              Measure against the criteria defined in discovery, collect qualitative feedback relentlessly, and be brutally
              honest about what is or isn’t working.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Week 9: Decision.</strong> Go (plan the production build), pivot (refine the hypothesis), or kill (document
              the learning and move on). Three options, minimal sunk cost, maximum learning.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <figure>
            <img src="assets/from-ai-hype/image-001.png" alt="Nine-week experiment cycle timeline" />
            <figcaption>Nine disciplined weeks are enough to prove value—or prove it isn’t there—without burning political capital.</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <h2>What This Enables</h2>
          <p>
            In nine weeks you’re out a modest amount, not millions after eighteen months. You build capability by doing,
            not theorizing. Your portfolio becomes a mix of active experiments, production builds, and intentional kills.
            Real example: we tested GenAI for document summarization, had a working prototype by week four, validated with
            real users in week six, and went to production by month four. Cost: a fraction of a traditional “AI strategy.”
          </p>

          <h2>The Non-Negotiables</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Start with data, not tech.</strong> Invest in governance, quality, and access in parallel with AI experiments.</li>
            <li><strong>Solve problems, don’t deploy technology for its own sake.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Keep investments proportional to certainty.</strong> Low certainty = low spend; only scale what’s proven.</li>
            <li><strong>Create safe space for failure.</strong> Budget for multiple experiments knowing some will fail. Learning is the win.</li>
            <li><strong>Build through doing.</strong> Capability grows via hands-on experimentation, not consultant decks.</li>
            <li><strong>Balance speed with responsibility.</strong> Bake explainability, bias reviews, and privacy safeguards into every test.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Where to Start</h2>
          <h3>This Week</h3>
          <p>Educate leadership on what AI actually is and isn’t. Create shared vocabulary, identify 3–5 pain points, and assess whether the necessary data exists.</p>
          <h3>This Month</h3>
          <p>Pick one pain point to experiment with. Assemble a small team, run your first nine-week experiment, and set aside budget for 3–5 total experiments expecting only 1–2 to succeed.</p>
          <h3>This Quarter</h3>
          <p>Build a portfolio of experiments—some running, some complete. Share learnings across the organization, scale the winners, and celebrate what you kill.</p>
          <p>Good starting points:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Document summarization or review (GenAI)</li>
            <li>Predictive analytics on existing processes (ML)</li>
            <li>Extracting structured data from unstructured documents (NLP + CV)</li>
            <li>Automating repetitive manual tasks (RPA)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Don’t start with:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>“AI strategy” boil-the-ocean initiatives</li>
            <li>Mission-critical decisions with zero tolerance for experimentation</li>
            <li>Areas where the required data doesn’t exist</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Building Capability, Not Just Use Cases</h2>
          <p>
            This isn’t just about deploying AI—it’s about building organizational capability. Learn faster than your
            competition, experiment constantly but responsibly, and only scale what you’ve proven works. In the rush to adopt
            AI, the winners won’t be those who spend first, but those who learn the fastest.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Stop planning. Start experimenting. Data first, problems first, prove it in nine weeks.</strong></p>

          <h3>Join the Conversation</h3>
