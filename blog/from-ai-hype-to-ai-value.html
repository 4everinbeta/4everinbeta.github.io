        <h1>From AI Hype to AI Value: A Data-First, Experiment-Driven Philosophy</h1>
        <p class="hero__intro">
          Boards keep asking how quickly we can “get AI into production.” The better question is how fast
          we can learn what AI can really do for our business without betting the entire roadmap. This
          essay captures the data-first, experiment-driven playbook I use to separate hype from value.

          <p>
            Week after week I watch well-intentioned organizations treat AI adoption like an old-school
            enterprise software rollout. Months of planning, millions invested, and almost no empirical
            learning. The predictable result: stalled “strategies,” bruised credibility, and battle fatigue
            for the teams closest to the work.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the last several years I have studied the patterns behind AI wins and losses, and I’ve
            led enough initiatives to know the difference between hype and repeatable value. Three beliefs
            sit at the core of any successful program: <strong>data first</strong>,
            <strong>problems first</strong>, and <strong>experiments first</strong>.
          </p>

          <h2>My Philosophy</h2>
          <h3>Data First</h3>
          <p>
            Every failed AI program I’ve audited had the same root cause: the team tried to “figure out the
            data later.” Data is not an IT chore; it’s a strategic product. Treat those who consume data as
            your customers, establish explicit ownership for quality and availability, and measure success
            like any other product. Clean data paired with a simple model beats messy data and a bleeding-edge
            algorithm every single time.
          </p>

          <h3>Problems First</h3>
          <p>
            AI is not a science project. Begin with a real, costly, measurable pain point. Map the workflow,
            interview the people actually doing the work, and define what success would look like before you
            even whisper “model.” When technology serves a tightly defined problem, business value follows.
          </p>

          <h3>Experiments First</h3>
          <p>
            The organizations winning with AI are not necessarily the ones spending the most—they are the
            ones learning the fastest. That means small bets, fast feedback, and the humility to kill ideas
            that don’t prove value. Borrow from design thinking: prototype, test, measure, and iterate.
          </p>

          <h2>Choosing the Right Tool</h2>
          <p>
            “AI” is an umbrella term. Traditional AI and machine learning excel at analysis, prediction, and
            classification. Generative AI shines when you need to create or transform content—summaries,
            Q&amp;A, conversational retrieval. Robotic Process Automation tackles deterministic, repetitive
            workflows. Knowing which category your problem fits keeps you from forcing GenAI onto a prediction
            problem or vice versa.
          </p>

          <h2>The 9-Week Experiment Cycle</h2>
          <p>
            Years of experimentation led me to a repeatable framework: a nine-week cycle that de-risks AI
            investments while creating a portfolio of learnings.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Discover (Weeks 1–2):</strong> Pick one measurable pain point and map the current
              journey. Interview the doers, not just the managers, and audit data availability and quality.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Define &amp; Design (Week 3):</strong> Craft a crisp hypothesis—
              “If we apply <em>this</em> technique to <em>that</em> data set, we expect <em>this</em> measurable
              outcome.” Scope the minimal experiment and set success/failure criteria.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Prototype (Weeks 4–6):</strong> Build just enough to learn. Favor off-the-shelf tools,
              tiny teams, and time-boxed sprints over bespoke engineering.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Test &amp; Validate (Weeks 7–8):</strong> Put the prototype in front of real users doing
              real work. Measure against the criteria you committed to in Week 1 and capture qualitative
              feedback relentlessly.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Decide (Week 9):</strong> Go, pivot, or kill. If it works, fund a production build. If
              it kind-of works, adjust the hypothesis and run another quick experiment. If it doesn’t,
              document the learning and move on—with minimal sunk cost.
            </li>
          </ol>

            <figcaption>In nine weeks you can prove value—or prove it isn’t there—and protect your runway.</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <h2>Non-Negotiables</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Start with data.</strong> Budget for governance, quality, and access in every experiment.</li>
            <li><strong>Solve real problems.</strong> Tie each experiment to a metric that matters to customers or operators.</li>
            <li><strong>Invest proportionally.</strong> Low certainty = low spend; only scale what is proven.</li>
            <li><strong>Create psychological safety.</strong> Celebrate fast failures; they prevent expensive ones.</li>
            <li><strong>Build by doing.</strong> Capability grows through hands-on experimentation, not endless slideware.</li>
            <li><strong>Pair speed with responsibility.</strong> Lightweight governance (explainability, bias checks, privacy)
              should accompany every test.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Where to Start</h2>
          <p>
            This week: align leadership on shared AI vocabulary and inventory 3–5 pain points with known
            data sources. This month: pick one pain point, assemble a small cross-functional squad, and kick
            off a 9-week experiment. This quarter: maintain a visible portfolio of experiments—some running,
            some shipping, some intentionally retired—with documented learnings.
          </p>
          <p>
            Great starter use cases include predictive analytics on existing processes, extracting structured
            data from unstructured documents, or automating repetitive back-office tasks. Avoid “AI strategy”
            boil-the-ocean efforts, mission-critical decisions with no guardrails, or areas where data simply
            doesn’t exist yet.
          </p>

          <p>
            AI transformation will not be won by the earliest adopters or the biggest budgets. The winners
            will be the organizations that learn the fastest—those who treat data as a product, frame clear
            problems, and run a steady cadence of experiments that either prove value or free them to chase
            the next idea.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Stop planning. Start experimenting. Data first, problems first, prove it in nine weeks.</strong></p>
