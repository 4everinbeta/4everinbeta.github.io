# RAG Assets

This directory is only a placeholder for the generated `documents.json` and
`vectors.json` files. They are created by `python build_embeddings.py` (locally or via
the GitHub Action) and uploaded to Cloudflare R2, so they no longer live in the repo.
Keeping this README ensures the folder exists so the script always has a write target.
